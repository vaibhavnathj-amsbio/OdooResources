                    <h2>(1) Introduction</h2>

                    <p>
                        Please read these terms of sale carefully.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        You will be asked to expressly agree to these terms of sale before you place an order for
                        products
                        from
                        our website.
                    </p>

                    <h2>(2) Interpretation</h2>

                    <p>
                        In these terms of sale, "we" means AMS Biotechnology (and "us" and "our" will be construed
                        accordingly);
                        and "you" means our customer or potential customer for products (and "your" will be construed
                        accordingly).
                    </p>

                    <h2>(3) Order process</h2>
                    <p>
                        The advertising of products on our website constitutes an "invitation to treat"; and your order
                        for
                        products constitutes a contractual offer. No contract will come into force between you and us
                        unless
                        and
                        until we accept your order in accordance with the procedure detailed below.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        In order to enter into a contract to purchase products from us, you will need to take the

                        steps: (i) you must add the products you wish to purchase to your shopping cart, and then
                        proceed to
                        the
                        checkout; (ii) if you do not have a credit account with us you may pay for your order with an
                        acceptable
                        bank or credit card or contact our sales office to request a pro-forma invoice or the opening of
                        a
                        credit account (a request which may or may not be granted); if you are an existing customer with
                        a
                        credit account you may instead elect to charge the purchase to your account; (iii) you must
                        select
                        your

                        (iv) if

                        have elected to pay by an acceptable bank or credit card you will be transferred to our payment
                        gateway

                        payment)
                        is/are processed successfully the web site will acknowledge your order and we will send you an
                        email

                        order,
                        we
                        will either send you an order confirmation (at which point your order will become a binding
