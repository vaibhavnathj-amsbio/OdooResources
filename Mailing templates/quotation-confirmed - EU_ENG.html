    <p>Dear ${object.partner_id.name},</p>
    <p>Thank you for ordering from us!</p>

    <p>Can you please take time to read carefully and provide within 24 hours the following information in relation to
        the attached order confirmation to help us to ensure a smooth delivery of your order : <br />
        <br />
        <b>1.Required information :</b><br />
        <&nbsp;&nbsp;>- <u>Your company/Institution EORI number</u> (as being importer), provided from your financial
            department. <br />
            <&nbsp;&nbsp;>- <u>A named individual in your institute/company and their contact</u> telephone number and
                email for customs clearance. This may Include a payment of VAT or import duties. Please be aware that
                import VAT is usually reclaimed (or exempted) by your institution and therefore it is not an additional
                cost.
                <br />
                <br />
                Please note your institute/company is the importer of record and needs to account for import VAT, small
                customs fees (10 to 30â‚¬) and, in the unlikely event, import duties. <u>Your country customs may send you
                    an invoice to require these costs before delivery of your product(s)</u>. This is very important for
                dry ice shipments where delays may mean your products are damaged. AMSBIO does not take responsibility
                for damage to products due to customs delays, rejected deliveries or VAT and duty payment delays caused
                by you as the importer.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>2. Optional information (but useful)</b>
                <&nbsp;&nbsp;> - <u>In case you are exempted from paying VAT and you have this proof</u>, please send us
                    scanned copy so our courier can provide it to the customs authorities in your country. This may
                    avoid a VAT payment before delivery.
                    <&nbsp;&nbsp;> - <u>If you have an account with DHL</u> please provide your account number, often
                        this facilitates clearance and delivery. We will not use these account numbers for delivery
                        costs but only for payment of your import VAT and duties (if applicable).
    </p>

    <p>Kind regards,</p>
